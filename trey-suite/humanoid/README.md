# BFF Humanoid (MVP)
- Put your model at `trey-suite/assets/humanoid.glb` (head or full body, GLB/GLTF).
- Page: `/trey-suite/humanoid/index.html`
- Mic: basic amplitude-driven lip flap (visemes coming next).
- Next steps:
  1) Export GLB with blendshapes (ARKit/OVR names) for visemes.
  2) Map neural TTS visemes -> morph targets.
  3) Add gaze/blink/idle animations and emotion states.
